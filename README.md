In this Spline tutorial, Adi Purdila will take you on a journey through Spline, helping you discover the joy of 3D from a complete beginner’s perspective and bring your own 3D ideas to life. We’ll keep things simple and practical—that means minimal theory and plenty of step-by-step practical exercises.

We’ll cover 3D modelling, materials and textures, lighting, environments, animation, interaction, and plenty more besides.
